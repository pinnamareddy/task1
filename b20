HTTP (hyper text transfer protocol)
transfer protocol is an application protocol which is used for data communnication
 HTTP 1.1 (1997)                                HTTP2(2015)
1)older version (time period :- long)         1)obviously better than http 1.1 we can also 
                                               say that it is used to resolve many issues 
                                               created by http 1.1                                                
2)at present web pages are created with        2) which resolved in this
  lots of images/gifs/links which slow down
  the loading a page 
3)to avoid the above problem reduce the number  3) which allows the server push
  HTTP connections which may cause the 
  furstration customers
4)domain sharding (which is used in such        4)which is resolved in this(multiplexing in single tcp)
   a way that limits the downloads/use of that 
   web page /like queue 6 step tcp connections)
5)image spirites (this is also a thing that     5)which takes the less time to load
   if many images open it take time to load 
   and generates multiple server requests)
6)concatination this is to reeduce the no       6)in this which the server works better 
  of requests to load the page fast               and (server push,compressed the header&data
                                                  and more secure than http 1.1)



2) http version history
   (hyper text transfer protocol)
   1) transfer protocol is an application protocol which is used for data communnication exchange in world wide web
   2) http1.0(1996) http1.1(1997) http2(2015) http3(upcoming) are the versions
   in which solving the problems the versions were evolved one after other like lots of images/gifs/sources/increase in no of http connections
   this is simple that http1.1 uses the 6 step tcp, http2 uses single tcp, http3 uses the quic tcp which in progress
   ***every version is same but the way of approch is different and increases the speed 

3)  javascript                                                    nodejs
    1) this is a programing language                             1) this is an interpreter or running environment for java script
    2)this ir runs in chrome ,firefox                            2) which runs in v8 engine
    3)mainly used for client side/frontend                       3)this dones the backend job
    4)this only run in browser                                   4) runs outside the browser
    5)this is uses/add the html tags                             5)these dont add the html tags
    6)this written in js and c++                                 6)this written in javascript

4) what happens when you type url/address in url bar or browser
   in this when you hit the enter after entering the url then first http reequest is send to the server and http response is sent back to the client (loads the page)
   in this which the first (1)pysical layer and the follws the (2)link layer ,(3)network layer in this (4)transport layer helps to (5)transport through the network layer and 
   reaches the (6)appilication layer
   this is the way how appilication communicate with each other
